# Project "CinnamonToast"
Project CinnamonToast (as referred by it's codename) is a project that creates a cross-platform UI framework that's fast, modern and easy to work with. It's based on .xml and shared library files, as well as an IDE (CinnamonToast IDE) written in .NET. 
Currently, since its a very early project, there are still a TON of problems (like memory leaks, performance issues or UI issues) that will be addressed in the future.
